A reading tracking app developed as a group

Customizable reading tracker for tracking any assignment or reading. 

Comes with reading reminders (sent through email), scalable features, and a customizable and easy to use UI.

Created for use by students primarily, but also for others that are trying to get back into reading and need gentle reminders to keep them on track.

Front-end coded in Agile and HTML.

Backend coded in Python with connections to AWS Dynamo DB. If using, please don't forget to replace the access_key, secret_key, region, and table_name (if you would like).
